"""Deterministic AI-pattern scanner for prose.

Scans text for mechanical AI-writing tells: chat debris, typography
conventions, formula phrases, and structural regularity metrics. Output is
stable and sorted, so repeated runs on the same input produce identical
results — usable as a gate in a rewrite loop.

A hit is a place to look, not an automatic rewrite. Every phrase and
typography hit must be verified against the false-positive rules
(references/ai-patterns-universal.md, "What NOT to Flag") before editing.
Only DEBRIS hits are unconditional.

Usage:
    slop-scan.py FILE [FILE...]          scan files
    cat draft.md | slop-scan.py          scan stdin
    slop-scan.py --channel im FILE       skip checks that don't apply to IM
    slop-scan.py --allow em-dash FILE    suppress a rule (e.g. voice profile
                                         permits em dashes)

Each channel suppresses the rules that its medium legitimately breaks — see
CHANNEL_SUPPRESS. Procedures are meant to be uniform; dialogue is meant to
use dashes. DEBRIS is never suppressed, by channel or by --allow.

Exit codes: 0 clean (structure notes only), 1 phrase/typography hits,
2 debris present.
